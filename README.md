# schoolscheduler
## Purpose
I created this out of a need to help my children quickly register for classes when seconds counted as they filled up.

## Solution
Creates permutations of possible school schedules for students to help them during registration. The software simplifies the possible schedule iterations, helping them shuffle around multiple options to get their ideal class and instructor set. It also allows them to quickly adapt to classes that are filled up to find the ideal schedule.  Originally developed for a simple high school schedule, it could be adapted for university.
